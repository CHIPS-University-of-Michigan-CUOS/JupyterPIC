Notice how different the two distribution functions look; the electron distribution is incredibly flat, and the ion distribution is incredibly narrow and sharply peaked.  Because of the huge difference in their thermal velocities, it is possible to excite a wave whose phase velocity, $v_p = \\omega / k$, is simultaneously much smaller than the thermal velocity of electrons, and much larger than the thermal velocity of ions.  These conditions give rise to an ion acoustic wave, a type of electrostatic wave that can propogate through a plasma.  \n",
